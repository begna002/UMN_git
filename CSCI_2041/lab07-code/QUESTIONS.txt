PROBLEM 1: Higher-order Practice and Currying
=============================================

  The file `nested_lists.ml' contains two nested lists,
  - strll : string list list
  - intll : int list list
  Several functions are described in this file that operate on such
  nested lists.  Fill in their definitions. All of them involve
  application of appropriate higher-order functions on lists.  Some of
  them may also benefit from partial application of curried functions.
  You may freely alter prototypes such as adding/removing arguments so
  long as the resulting functions work as indicated in the examples.

  ,----
  | (* nested_lists.ml: Define some functions on nested lists (e.g. int
  |    list list and string list list) using higher-order functions. *)
  | 
  | open Printf;;
  | 
  | (* sample string list list *)
  | let strll = [
  |     ["Korra";"Mako";"Bolin";"Asami";];
  |     ["Tenzin";"Pema"];
  |     ["Meelo";"Jinora";"Iki"];
  |     ["Amon";"Kuvira";"Zaheer"];
  | ];;
  | 
  | (* sample int list list *)
  | let intll = [
  |     [1;2;3];
  |     [4;5;6];
  |     [7;8;9;10];
  |     [11];
  | ];;
  | 
  | (* val flatten : 'a list list -> 'a list
  | 
  |    Converts a list of lists to a single "flat" list. Each list is
  |    appended onto the last.  Since this function is polymorphic, no
  |    special versions are needed for different types of list.  Makes use
  |    of List.fold_left. This function is equivalent to the standard
  |    List.flatten function built into ocaml. 
  | 
  |    # flatten intll;;
  |    - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11]
  |    # flatten strll;;
  |    - : string list =
  |    ["Korra"; "Mako"; "Bolin"; "Asami"; "Tenzin"; "Pema"; "Meelo"; "Jinora";
  |     "Iki"; "Amon"; "Kuvira"; "Zaheer"]
  | *)
  | let flatten list_list =
  |   List.fold_left (@) [] list_list
  | ;;
  | 
  | (* val totlen : 'a list list -> int
  | 
  |    Calculates the total length of all combined lists using fold_left.
  |    Does not use flatten but does use List.length.
  | 
  |    # totlen intll;;
  |    - : int = 11
  |    # totlen strll;;
  |    - : int = 12
  | *)
  | let totlen list_list =
  |   let flat = List.fold_left (@) [] list_list in
  |	List.length flat
  | ;;
  | 
  | 
  | (* val print_list_list : ('a -> unit) -> 'a list list -> unit
  | 
  |    Print all lists in a list. argument print_elem is a function that
  |    prints the a single element of any list.  Each list is printed on
  |    its own line starting with an open square brace [ and ending with a
  |    clsoe square brace ].  See specific output for print_str_list_list
  |    and print int_list_list below which both use this function. 
  | *)
  | let print_list_list print_elem listlist =
  |   let print_elems list =
  |     printf "[";
  |     List.iter print_elem list;
  |     printf "]\n";
  |   in
  |   List.iter print_elems listlist
  | ;;
  | 
  | (* val print_str_list_list : string list list -> unit
  | 
  |    Print all string lists in a list. Each string is printed preceded
  |    by a space. Otherwise the conventions of print_list_list are used.
  | 
  |    # print_str_list_list strll;;
  |    [ Korra Mako Bolin Asami]
  |    [ Tenzin Pema]
  |    [ Meelo Jinora Iki]
  |    [ Amon Kuvira Zaheer]
  |    - : unit = ()
  | *)
  | let print_str_list_list =
  |   print_list_list (printf " %s")  
  | ;;
  | 
  | (* val print_int_list_list : int list list -> unit
  | 
  |    Print all int lists in a list. Each integer is printed preceded by
  |    a space. Otherwise the conventions of print_list_list are used.
  | 
  |    # print_int_list_list intll;;
  |    [ 1 2 3]
  |    [ 4 5 6]
  |    [ 7 8 9 10]
  |    [ 11]

PROBLEM 2: Curry Trouble
========================

  The provided file `curry_trouble.ml' is intended to compile and run as
  follows.
  ,----
  | > ocamlc curry_trouble.ml 
  | > ./a.out 
  | usage: ./a.out base start stop
  | 
  | > ./a.out 2 1 10
  | 2^1 is 2
  | 2^2 is 4
  | 2^3 is 8
  | 2^4 is 16
  | 2^5 is 32
  | 2^6 is 64
  | 2^7 is 128
  | 2^8 is 256
  | 2^9 is 512
  | 2^10 is 1024
  | 
  | > ./a.out 3 4 8
  | 3^4 is 81
  | 3^5 is 243
  | 3^6 is 729
  | 3^7 is 2187
  | 3^8 is 6561
  `----

  Unfortunately, `curry_trouble.ml' currently has an error in it which
  prevents it from being compiled.  OCaml's automatic function currying
  makes this error somewhat more obscure than it might otherwise
  be. This problem explores this issue to practice debugging type
  errors.

  ,----
  | (* curry_trouble.ml: Debug the following code which has a compile time
  |    error due to a partial application. *)
  | 
  | open Printf;;
  | 
  | (* raise base to given exp *)
  | let pow base exp =
  |   let ans = ref 1 in
  |   for i=1 to exp do
  |     ans := !ans * base;
  |   done;
  |   !ans
  | ;;
  | 
  | (* print successive powers *)
  | let print_powers base start stop =
  |   for i=start to stop do
  |     let x = pow base in
  |     printf "%d^%d is %d\n" base i x;
  |   done;
  | ;;
  |       
  | (* main function *)
  | let _ =
  |   if Array.length Sys.argv < 4 then
  |     begin
  |       printf "usage: %s base start stop\n" Sys.argv.(0);
  |       exit 1;
  |     end;
  |   let base  = int_of_string Sys.argv.(1) in
  |   let start = int_of_string Sys.argv.(2) in
  |   let stop  = int_of_string Sys.argv.(3) in
  |   print_powers base start stop;
  | ;;
  `----


(A)
~~~

  Compile the `curry_trouble.ml' as shown above and paste the compile
  error that results below.
  
  File "curry_trouble.ml", line 19, characters 34-35:
  Error: This expression has type int -> int
         but an expression was expected of type int


(B)
~~~

  The error message proclaims that this is a type problem. This is not
  wrong, just misleading.

  Spend some time examining the code and correct the error. Describe
  what the true problem is and show below the line(s) which need to be
  changed to produce a working version of `curry_trouble.ml'.

Line 18 calls the function pow with only one parameter, however the function requires 2 (a base and a power).

Change to line 18: 
let x = pow base i in


(C)
~~~

  Describe why OCaml reports a type error for the original code on a
  different line from where the error actually occurs. Relate your
  discussion to curried functions and partial applications.

	
Because ocaml allows curried funtions, the value of x in the original code was assigned to a function (type int -> int) waiting for one more parameter. However, since no other parameters where passed to it, when the code tried to print the value of x using %d, it reported an error where it expected a type int


(D)
~~~

  Once you have identified the problem with `curry_trouble.ml', consider
  the equivalent Java program that is provided in `Uncurried.java'.  The
  mistake that is made in this file is identical.  Compile it as follows
  and show the error message given. Describe whether you feel this error
  message is more or less indicative of the underlying problem and why.

  ,----
  | > javac Uncurried.java
  `----
   Uncurried.java:12: error: method pow in class Uncurried cannot be applied to given types;
         int x = pow(base);
                 ^
     required: int,int
     found: int
     reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
   1 error

This error is more indicative of the problem. Because Java doesn’t allow curried functions, it will explicitly state if a function was called without the proper number of parameters.


(E)
~~~

  Describe the cost associated with OCaml's automatic currying of
  functions.  Also describe if there is any way to avoid these problems
  if curried functions are not needed: how would one enforce all
  arguments be given together as a package in OCaml?

  
A major cost of using curried functions is the problem of accidently passing in less parameters to a function than required, causing an error.
Using tuple arguments of any length (doube, triple, etc), where the length is based on the the number of parameters passed in, can mitigate this issue by ensuring that the any call to a function has that same type.


PROBLEM 3: Objects... or Closures?
==================================

  Object-oriented programming frequently features a syntax that looks
  looks like the following:
  ,----
  | My_Object my_object = new My_Object(init1,init2);
  | my_object.some_method(param1,param2);
  `----
  OCaml has an object system that works similarly to this which we will
  discuss later.  However, with the introduction of first-class
  functions, we are already in a position to create an ad-hoc object
  system that looks and behaves very similarly to the above
  template. The problem explores the file `closure_objects.ml' which
  demonstrates this concept.


(A)
~~~

  Examine the file `closure_objects.ml' and describe
  - What kind of "object" is defined
  - What data is associated with instances of these objects
  - What "methods" (operations) are supported for the data

The file implements a “person” pbject that has 2 data values that are mutable, “name” (which is a string) and “age” (which is an integer). There are also 3 methods associated with the object: birthday() (which increments the persons age by 1, name_change (which changes the name of the person), and to_string() (which returns a string representation of the person object).


(B)
~~~

  Describe how to create an instance of the "objects" defined in
  `closure_object.ml'.  What function is used, what arguments does it
  take, and what type of thing does it return.

The function make_person is used in order to make a person object, and it takes in 2 parameters: string name and int age. The function then returns a record of type person.


(C)
~~~

  Describe the syntax used to initiate the `birthday' method. Give an
  example from the later "main" function. What type of thing is the
  `birthday' field of each record bound to?


As shown in line 44 of the file, the birthday method is initialized as
Person.birthday(). “Birthday” is bound to a function within the make_person function that takes in unit() and returns unit().


(D) OPTIONAL Enrichment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The `make_person' uses an interesting technique that we have not
  discussed.  The binding starts with
  ,----
  | let rec this = {
  `----
  and proceeds to use `and' bindings as in
  ,----
  | and birthday_func () =
  | ...
  | and name_change_func name =
  `----

  Note that the name `this' is NOT special in OCaml: it was chosen to
  match the convention of C++/Java where `this' refers to the object
  instance associated with a running method.

  To this point, we have only seen `rec' associated with recursive
  functions.  Clearly, the `this' is neither recursive nor a function.
  Neither are any of the functions associated with it recursive.

  Make a copy of `closure_objects.ml' and experiment eliminating the
  `rec' and defining the record and functions separately with standard
  `let/in' syntax.  Describe your results.

  Do some research on the purpose of `let rec/and' in OCaml and describe
  its use case.
