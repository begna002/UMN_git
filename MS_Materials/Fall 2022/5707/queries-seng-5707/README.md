# SENG 5707

## Getting started with querying using Oracle+RA package

### Instructions:

- Ensure you have a CSE Labs account. https://wwws.cs.umn.edu/account-management
- Login into a CSE machine using putty/ssh with your UMN credentials. https://cseit.umn.edu/computer-classrooms/cse-labs-unix-machine-listings
- Clone/download this repository. `git clone <HTTPS or SSH URL>`
- Change to root directory of the repo. `cd queries-seng-5707`
- Access Oracle using the following commands.
   - (We will provide you the username/password for `ora19`)
   - (`rlwrap` is a utility that provides the ability to press the Up arrow to reload and edit previous commands.)

    ```bash
    module load soft/oracle
    rlwrap sqlplus YOURUSERNAME@ora19
    <Enter password when prompted>
    ```

- Create tables using the script:
    ```sql
    @music/create
    ```

- Insert data using the script:
    ```sql
    @music/insert
    ```

- Set some reasonable display settings (column widths, etc.)
    ```sql
    @music/format
    ```

- Examine some of the data:
    ```sql
    select * from song;
    select * from songstream;
    select * from artist;
    select * from favouritesongs;
    select * from album;
    select * from region;
    select * from serviceuser;
    ```

- Execute sample query using the script:
    ```sql
    @music/popsong/run
    ```

- Examine some of the data generated by the query:
    ```sql
    select * from song_with_total_streams;
    select * from genre_with_max_total_streams;
    ```

- To drop the tables use:
    ```sql
    @music/popsong/drop
    @music/drop
    ```

### Data description

A sample data from the Kaggle dataset - [Spotify Worldwide daily song rating](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking) is used. The query attempts to discover songs that were most popular in every genre.
